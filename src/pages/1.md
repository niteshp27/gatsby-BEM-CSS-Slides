## Intro to BEM CSS Methodology ?
BEM — Block Element Modifier is a methodology that helps you to create reusable components and code sharing in front-end development.
BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a component-based approach to web development. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. This makes interface development easy and fast even with a complex UI, and it allows reuse of existing code without copying and pasting.
Methodology BEM was invented at Yandex (Goolge of Russia) to develop sites which should be launched fast and supported for a long time. 


# Why BEM ?
Using beautiful classname with BEM standard.
You can customize your own classname with rules we provided.
It helps to create extendable and reusable interface components.
BEM is a highly useful, powerful, and simple naming convention that makes your front-end code easier to read and understand.
It is easier to work with, easier to scale, more robust and explicit, and a lot more strict.
The BEM approach ensures that everyone who participates in the development of a website works with a single codebase and speaks the same language. Using BEM’s proper naming convention will better prepare you for design changes made to your website.

> Modularity
Block styles are never dependent on other elements on a page, so you will never experience problems from cascading.
You also get the ability to transfer blocks from your finished projects to new ones.

> Structure
BEM methodology gives your CSS code a solid structure that remains simple and easy to understand.


> Reusability
Composing independent blocks in different ways, and reusing them intelligently, reduces the amount of CSS code that you will have to maintain. 
With a set of style guidelines in place, you can build a library of blocks, making your CSS super effective.
