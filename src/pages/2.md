## Blocks, Elements and Modifiers

<img href="../images/block.png">

<hr/>

*Blocks : Standalone entity that is meaningful on its own. 
*Examples : header, container, menu, checkbox, input

<hr/>

*Element : Parts of a block and have no standalone meaning. They are semantically tied to its block. 
*Examples : menu item, list item, checkbox caption, header title

<hr/>

*Modifier : Flags on blocks or elements. Use them to change appearance or behavior. 
*Examples : disabled, highlighted, checked, fixed, size big, color yellow

## Block
A functionally independent page component that can be reused. In HTML, blocks are represented by the class attribute.
Features:
The block name describes its purpose ("What is it?" — menu or button), not its state ("What does it look like?" — red or big).
Example
```html 
    <!-- Correct. The `error` block is semantically meaningful -->
    <div class="error"></div>

    <!-- Incorrect. It describes the appearance -->
    <div class="red-text"></div>
```
The block shouldn't influence its environment, meaning you shouldn't set the external geometry (margin) or positioning for the block.
You also shouldn't use CSS tag or ID selectors when using BEM.
This ensures the necessary independence for reusing blocks or moving them from place to place.

## Element
A composite part of a block that can't be used separately from it.
Features:
The element name describes its purpose ("What is this?" — item, text, etc.), not its state ("What type, or what does it look like?" — red, big, etc.).
The structure of an element's full name is block-name__element-name. The element name is separated from the block name with a double underscore (__).
Example
```html
    <!-- `search-form` block -->
    <form class="search-form">
        <!-- `input` element in the `search-form` block -->
        <input class="search-form__input">
        <!-- `button` element in the `search-form` block -->
        <button class="search-form__button">Search</button>
    </form>
```

### Should I create a block or an element?
Create a block
If a section of code might be reused and it doesn't depend on other page components being implemented.

Create an element
If a section of code can't be used separately without the parent entity (the block).

### When do we use Modifier?
The exception is elements that must be divided into smaller parts – subelements – in order to simplify development. In the BEM methodology, you can't create elements of elements. In a case like this, instead of creating an element, you need to create a service block.

## Modifier

An entity that defines the appearance, state, or behavior of a block or element.
Features:
The modifier name describes its appearance ("What size?" or "Which theme?" and so on — size_s or theme_islands), its state ("How is it different from the others?" — disabled, focused, etc.) and its behavior ("How does it behave?" or "How does it respond to the user?" — such as directions_left-top).
The modifier name is separated from the block or element name by a single underscore (_).

### Types of modifiers
Boolean
Used when only the presence or absence of the modifier is important, and its value is irrelevant. For example, disabled. If a Boolean modifier is present, its value is assumed to be true.
The structure of the modifier's full name follows the pattern:
* block-name_modifier-name
* block-name__element-name_modifier-name

Key-value
Used when the modifier value is important. For example, "a menu with the islands design theme": menu_theme_islands.
The structure of the modifier's full name follows the pattern:
* block-name_modifier-name_modifier-value
* block-name__element-name_modifier-name_modifier-value
