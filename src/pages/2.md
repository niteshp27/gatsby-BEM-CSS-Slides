## Blocks, Elements and Modifiers

<img href="../images/block.png">

<hr/>

*Blocks : Standalone entity that is meaningful on its own. <br/>
*Examples : header, container, menu, checkbox, input<br/>

<hr/>

*Element : Parts of a block and have no standalone meaning. They are semantically tied to its block. <br/>
*Examples : menu item, list item, checkbox caption, header title<br/>

<hr/>

*Modifier : Flags on blocks or elements. Use them to change appearance or behavior. <br/>
*Examples : disabled, highlighted, checked, fixed, size big, color yellow<br/>

## Block
A functionally independent page component that can be reused. In HTML, blocks are represented by the class attribute.<br/>
Features:<br/>
The block name describes its purpose ("What is it?" — menu or button), not its state ("What does it look like?" — red or big).<br/>
Example<br/>
```html
    <!-- Correct. The `error` block is semantically meaningful -->
    <div class="error"></div>

    <!-- Incorrect. It describes the appearance -->
    <div class="red-text"></div>
```
The block shouldn't influence its environment, meaning you shouldn't set the external geometry (margin) or positioning for the block.<br/>
You also shouldn't use CSS tag or ID selectors when using BEM.<br/>
This ensures the necessary independence for reusing blocks or moving them from place to place.<br/>

<hr/>

## Element
A composite part of a block that can't be used separately from it.<br/>
Features:<br/>
The element name describes its purpose ("What is this?" — item, text, etc.), not its state ("What type, or what does it look like?" — red, big, etc.).<br/>
The structure of an element's full name is ``` block-name__element-name ```. The element name is separated from the block name with a double underscore (```__```).<br/>
Example<br/>
```html
    <!-- `search-form` block -->
    <form class="search-form">
        <!-- `input` element in the `search-form` block -->
        <input class="search-form__input">
        <!-- `button` element in the `search-form` block -->
        <button class="search-form__button">Search</button>
    </form>
```

### Should I create a block or an element?
Create a block<br/>
If a section of code might be reused and it doesn't depend on other page components being implemented.<br/><br/>

Create an element<br/>
If a section of code can't be used separately without the parent entity (the block).<br/>

### When do we use Modifier?
The exception is elements that must be divided into smaller parts – subelements – in order to simplify development. In the BEM methodology, you can't create elements of elements. In a case like this, instead of creating an element, you need to create a service block.<br/>

<hr/>

## Modifier

An entity that defines the appearance, state, or behavior of a block or element.<br/>
Features:<br/>
The modifier name describes its appearance ("What size?" or "Which theme?" and so on — size_s or theme_islands), its state ("How is it different from the others?" — disabled, focused, etc.) and its behavior ("How does it behave?" or "How does it respond to the user?" — such as directions_left-top).<br/>
The modifier name is separated from the block or element name by a single underscore (_).<br/>

### Types of modifiers
* Boolean<br/>
Used when only the presence or absence of the modifier is important, and its value is irrelevant. For example, disabled. If a Boolean modifier is present, its value is assumed to be true.<br/>
The structure of the modifier's full name follows the pattern:
```  block-name_modifier-name```
``` block-name__element-name_modifier-name```
<br/><br/>
* Key-value<br/>
Used when the modifier value is important. For example, "a menu with the islands design theme": ``` menu_theme_islands``` .<br/>
The structure of the modifier's full name follows the pattern:
``` block-name_modifier-name_modifier-value```
``` block-name__element-name_modifier-name_modifier-value```
