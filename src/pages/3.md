##### Block
A functionally independent page component that can be reused. In HTML, blocks are represented by the class attribute.
Features:
The block name describes its purpose ("What is it?" — menu or button), not its state ("What does it look like?" — red or big).
Example
```html
    <!-- Correct. The `error` block is semantically meaningful -->
    <div class="error"></div>

    <!-- Incorrect. It describes the appearance -->
    <div class="red-text"></div>
```
The block shouldn't influence its environment, meaning you shouldn't set the external geometry (margin) or positioning for the block.
You also shouldn't use CSS tag or ID selectors when using BEM.
This ensures the necessary independence for reusing blocks or moving them from place to place.

##### Guidelines for using blocks
Nesting
Blocks can be nested in each other.
You can have any number of nesting levels.
Example
```html
    <!-- `header` block -->
    <header class="header">
        <!-- Nested `logo` block -->
        <div class="logo"></div>
        <!-- Nested `search-form` block -->
        <form class="search-form"></form>
    </header>
```
